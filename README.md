## Proposal
### GAM160 Assignment 1

For this game and alternative controller I have taken inspiration from an existing game called ‘Book of Fate’. 
This game puts the player in the role of a wizard and allows them to control the spells the character casts using a spell book. 
For my own game, I would like to create something similar.

	The concept of the game I want to make will be similar to that in ‘Book of Fate’, where the player is the wizard and they control the spells they cast using a book.
Additionally, the main mechanic of the game will also be the same, but narrative and other core mechanics will be different.

The main mechanic of the game will be casting spells using a physical copy of a spell book as the alternative controller, just like the ‘Book of Fate’ game.
Additionally, the main character will automatically move forward so the player’s only job is to choose and cast spells and keep track of the character’s health, just like the existing game.
However, unlike the existing game, I will be implementing either a magic bar or a delay feature. 
Both features offer additional challenges but has its individual limitations.
The magic bar will work similar to the health bar but will drain every time the player uses a spell.
The player will have the additional task of refilling the bar when it gets too low. 
However, this feature is limited to the fact the character is on a set path and the player does not control it.
Otherwise, the delay feature will prevent the player from using the same spell too many times. 
This is similar to an MMORPG where some abilities can only be used every two minutes, for example.
